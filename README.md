This project explores the use of genetic algorithms to solve various optimization problems. Genetic algorithms mimic evolutionary processes such as selection, crossover, and mutation to find optimal or near-optimal solutions in complex search spaces. The repository contains code for experiments and a web application that demonstrates how the algorithms work in practice on the knapsack problem. More information is available in the pdf file

This project was implemented in the winter semester of 2024 in the subject of HOP (Heuristic Optimization Processes). The project was carried out by Dmytro Skrypchenko, Daria Rezvin, Ostap Spas
